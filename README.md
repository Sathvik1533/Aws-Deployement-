# Aws-Deployement-
This project was part of a college-level cloud competition where I successfully deployed a static web portal using AWS infrastructure. The goal was to move from a local development environment to a live, publicly accessible cloud instance using a strictly Linux-based workflow.

Proof of Work (Technical Specs)
Since this instance is currently Stopped to optimize cloud costs, the following metadata from the deployment phase serves as the record of work:

AWS Instance ID: i-0304632065c9d9214

Public IPv4 Address: 3.110.104.180

Instance Type: t3.micro

Region: ap-south-1 (Mumbai)


Architecture: Integrated Amazon EC2 for compute and Amazon S3 for asset hosting.

Implementation Log

Environment Setup: Launched a Linux instance on EC2 and updated system packages via CLI.


Configuration: Set up the web server environment and managed public access via Security Groups.

Vibe-Coding Workflow: Leveraged AI-assisted rapid prototyping to automate deployment scripts and minimize infrastructure setup time.


Validation: Verified the deployment via Public DNS before final submission for judging.

Post-Deployment & Cost Optimization
Current Status: Archived / Stopped. As a professional best practice for personal cloud resource management, I follow a "Deploy-Validate-Archive" cycle. This instance was successfully validated by the MLRIT Cloud Challenge judges (3rd Prize Winner) and subsequently stopped to prevent unnecessary resource consumption.
